# Currency Converter

A simple Python script that converts Colombian Pesos (COP), Peruvian Soles (PEN), and Brazilian Reais (BRL) to US Dollars (USD) using current exchange rates.

## How it Works
1. The user enters amounts in COP, PEN, and BRL.
2. The script multiplies each amount by its USD exchange rate.
3. The script prints the converted USD amounts.

## Example
```
Enter amount in COP(Colombian pesos): 150000
Enter amount in PEN(Peruvian soles): 200
Enter amount in BRL(Brazilian reais): 300
150000 COP = $38.64 USD
200 PEN = $57.52 USD
300 BRL = $56.28 USD
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Download the `currency_converter.py` file.
2. Run it in a terminal or command prompt:
```
python currency_converter.py
```

## Notes
- Enter numeric values **without commas** (e.g., `150000` not `150,000`).  
- You can update the exchange rates in the script whenever needed.
